What is an Observable?

ans. Observable are various data sources like (user Input) Events, Http Requests, Triggered in Code.

It is an object that we import from a third party package, RxJs. 

We have an observable and a observer. In between we have a stream, a timeline and on this timeline we can have multiple events emitted by 
the observable or the data package emitted by the observable depending on the data source of that observable of course.

Observable could emit data because you trigger it to do so.You can do that programmatically. It could be connected to a button. And therefore 
whenever the button is clicked an event in a data package is emitted automatically or as the Angular Http service does it, its connected to
an Http request. So when response returns ,it is emitted as a data package. And there are dozens of data sources too.


The other part is the observer. We could actually say it is our code. It is the subscribe function that we saw in routing or atleast it has 
something to do with that.

You have 3 ways of handling data packages.
1. You can handle the normal data.
2. You can handle the error
3. You can handle the completion of the observable.

In this 3 hooks or boxes you can say we write the code that gets executed.
So we could determine what should happen if receive the data, or if we receive an error. What should happen when the observale 
eventually completes.

There are some observables hooked up to a button that never completes because how would you know when it completes?
Other observables like an http request will have a clear end and will complete actually.

We use it to handle asynchronous tasks

Observable has one major advantage. It is thier operator.

2.What is a subject?
Subject is an object you can subscribe to but its more active because you can actively call next on it from outside the observable. We use subjects for cross communication across components. We don't use subjects if we are using @Output with our own event .
